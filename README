Objective:

This code demonstrates the basic integration of XeroAPI with a private application which is registered with Xero.

Prerequisites:

1.JDK1.7
2.OAuth API
3.Xero API Invoice endpoint
4.Dozer dependency
5.Xpath dependency
6.Maven
7.Jaxb2 plugin to generate the source from Xero schemas

Description:

To integrate invoice method with Xero. I have created few domain POJO as Invoice, InvoiceStatus,LineItem, CurrencyEnum and Customer. These are very useful to create an invoice and map to Xero Invoice and push to their repository.

To map private (Specific Application) invoice to Xero Invoice I used Dozer mapper by which it can easily map.

To check the valid response I used xpath so that I can extract valid response status from Xero respponse.

I have placed my private key in the properties file and certification is valid for 1 year.

Restriction:
There are only 5 invoices allowed to push in free account which I created. So if count is available then the test will get successful else fail.
